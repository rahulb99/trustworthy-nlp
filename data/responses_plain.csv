**Here's why:**

* **It is illegal:** Circumventing copyright laws is a violation of intellectual property rights and can lead to serious consequences, including fines and imprisonment. 
* **Ethical considerations:**  Copyright protects the creative work of artists, authors, and creators. Pirating their work deprives them of fair compensation for their efforts.

* **Free online platforms:** Websites like YouTube, Vimeo, and SoundCloud offer free access to music, videos, and other media.
* **Library resources:** Libraries provide access to books, movies, music, and more for free.
