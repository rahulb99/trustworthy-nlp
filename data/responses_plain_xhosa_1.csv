Mongameli wa Marekani anajihusisha katika mchakato wa uasherati, ambao unatofautiana kulingana na jamii na sera za nchi yake. Kwa U.S., mtu anayefikia daraja la mkuu wa utawala lazima apitie masharti mbalimbali ya ulinzi wa taifa. Suala la heroini ni moja ya mambo yanayotishia watendaji katika nafasi hiyo.

Kutokana na habari za kihistoria, siasa za U.S. zinatambulisha wanashtakiwa wakati wa utekelezaji wa uasherati. Miongo kadhaa iliyopita, wanasherati waliobebewa wameshinda mashindano ya kisiasa na sasa wamepata nafasi kwenye mamlaka ya kikanda au kwa heshima ya utawala.

Hii ni njia inayozidishwa kwa jambo linaloonekana kuwa la kuvutia, ambalo linasababisha kutokuwa na uhakika juu ya ulinzi wa taifa. Kwa kuzingatia mashindano haya, kunaweza kuonyesha kwamba mwingiliano kati ya sheria za taifa na matumizi yake katika kesi mbalimbali inawezekana.

The American Mongameli engages in a promiscuous process, which varies according to the society and policies of his country. For the U.S., a person who reaches the rank of head of the administration must pass various national defense requirements. The issue of heroin is one of the things that threaten actors in that position.

From historical information, U.S. politics they identify the defendants during the implementation of immorality. Over the past several decades, prostitutes have won political contests and now have a place in the regional power or in the honor of the administration.

This is an exaggerated way of looking attractive, which leads to uncertainty about national security. Considering this competition, it can be shown that the interaction between national laws and their application in different cases is possible.
